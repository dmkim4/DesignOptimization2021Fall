 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.875   TIME= 15:00:03
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.875   TIME= 15:00:03
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.906   TIME= 15:00:03
 Material number 10 (used by element 8904) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.219   TIME= 15:00:03
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.22 is defined in the model.  Switch to   
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.172   TIME= 15:00:04
 For element 8904 the element connectivity is 0 and 13729.  The node     
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.859   TIME= 15:00:06
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
